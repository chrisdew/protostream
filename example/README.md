The example programme uses [protobuf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/protobuf) to encode and decode protocol buffers.

Other protobuf libraries are available, some of their maintainers even have windows machines on which to test ;)

Before running example.js, on Ubutu 14.04, type: 

"npm install protobuf" to install protobuf,

"apt-get install protobuf-compiler" to install "protoc" and finally

"make" to build the example.desc file from example.proto. 

(Pull requests for other OS instructions would be very welcome.)
